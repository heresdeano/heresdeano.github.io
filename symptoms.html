    <h2>Mania Symptoms</h2>
    <p>In the manic phase of bipolar disorder, it’s common to experience feelings of heightened energy, creativity, and euphoria. If you’re experiencing a manic episode, you may talk a mile a minute, sleep very little, and be hyperactive. You may also feel like you’re all-powerful, invincible, or destined for greatness.

But while mania feels good at first, it has a tendency to spiral out of control. You may behave recklessly during a manic episode: gambling away your savings, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making foolish business investments, for example. You may also become angry, irritable, and aggressive—picking fights, lashing out when others don’t go along with your plans, and blaming anyone who criticizes your behavior. Some people even become delusional or start hearing voices.
</p>
    <ul class="mania-style">
        <li>Feeling unusually "high" and optimistic <b>or</b> extremely irritable</li>
        <li>Unrealistic, grandiose beliefs about one's abilities or powers</li>
        <li>Sleeping very little, but feeling extremely energetic</li>
        <li>Talking so rapidly that others can't keep up</li>
        <li>Racing thoughts; jumping quickly from one idea to the next</li>
        <li>Highly distractable, unable to concentrate</li>
        <li>Impaired judgement and impulsiveness</li>
        <li>Acting recklessly without thinking about the consequences</li>
        <li>Delusions and hullcinations (in severe cases)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Depressed Symptoms</h2>
    <p>In the past, bipolar depression was lumped in with regular depression, but a growing body of research suggests that there are significant differences between the two, especially when it comes to recommended treatments. Most people with bipolar depression are not helped by antidepressants. In fact, there is a risk that antidepressants can make bipolar disorder worse—triggering mania or hypomania, causing rapid cycling between mood states, or interfering with other mood stabilizing drugs.

Despite many similarities, certain symptoms are more common in bipolar depression than in regular depression. For example, bipolar depression is more likely to involve irritability, guilt, unpredictable mood swings, and feelings of restlessness. With bipolar depression, you may move and speak slowly, sleep a lot, and gain weight. In addition, you’re more likely to develop psychotic depression—a condition in which you lose contact with reality—and to experience major problems in work and social functioning.</p>
